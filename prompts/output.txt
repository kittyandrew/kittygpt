Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
thoughts: {
// Thoughts
text: string;
reasoning: string;
// Short markdown-style bullet list that conveys the long-term plan
plan: string;
// Constructive self-criticism
criticism: string;
// Summary of thoughts to say to the user
speak: string;
};
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;
};
}
```
